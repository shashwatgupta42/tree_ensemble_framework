# Decision Tree and Tree Ensembles
In this project, I have written a framework, from scratch, which can implement decision trees and several ensemble methods.

It includes the following -
1) Simple Decision Trees (DecisionTree) (for both regression and classification)
2) Random Forest (RandomForest) (for both regression and classification) | Bagging can also be implemented using this.
3) AdaBoost for Classification (AdaBoostClassifier)
4) AdaBoost for Regression (AdaBoostRegressor) | Implementation of AdaBoost.R2 Algorithm
5) Gradient Boost for Regression (GradientBoostRegressor)
6) Gradient Boost for Classification (GradientBoostClassifier)

It can handle both discrete and continuous features. The discrete features need to be one-hot encoded if there are more than two categories.

I have also included a demo file. 

## Content
- framework.py - the main script
- demo.ipynb - demo file
- datasets - folder containing dataset file used in demo.ipynb
